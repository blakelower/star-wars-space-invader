# star-wars-space-invader

Taking it back to the basics with Vanilla JS! I re-created a Star Wars space invader game that has sounds effects,
PNG art and lasers all shooting all over the place. 
The player is able to mark their progress with the use of the score board and how many lives they are.
Star this project if you liked it :D and let me see what else you add to it!
